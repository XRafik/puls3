///   Otherwise the persisted envelope is sent again when it was never sent
///   or was last sent at least `resendAfter` ago. A resend the node refuses
///   ([RpcRequestRejected]) fails `SubmissionRejected`; an `ERROR` status
///   is logged and the record waits for its time bounds.
/// - `FAILED`: fails `TransactionFailed`.
/// - `SUCCESS`: `createJob` and `fund` need their escrow event (else
///   `JobEvidenceUnavailable`) and the [EscrowEffects] result decides
///   `confirmed` or the failure code. Other purposes stay `submitted` until
///   their effects exist.

/// envelope time bounds are checked against it. Only when the node does not
/// report it does the server clock decide expiry. Resend pacing always uses
