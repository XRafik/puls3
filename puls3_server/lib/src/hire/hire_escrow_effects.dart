/// The hire side of the escrow effects (api.md relay step 5).

/// `expired_at` from the preparation the submission relayed. A job id that
/// is already bound to another hire, or a hire that already holds another
/// job, is a `JobMismatch` on `job_id`. Applying it again is a no-op.
///
/// After a successful `fund`, [onFunded] reads the job from the escrow,
/// checks it against the hire with [verifyFunding] and, only if every check
/// passes, moves the hire to `funded` through [Hire.fund] and stores the payment
/// with the job id. Anything that does not match is a `JobMismatch` naming
/// the job field; a job the escrow cannot return is `JobEvidenceUnavailable`.
/// A failing chain read is thrown, so the tracker retries the submission. A
/// submission without a hire, or naming an unknown one, can never succeed and
/// is a terminal `JobMismatch` without a field.
///
/// `details.field` is `job_id` whenever the funding cannot be bound to the
/// hire although the job itself may be valid: the hire is already funded by
/// another transaction (replay), or the store reports that the hire, the
/// transaction or the job id is already bound (wrong transaction or
/// duplicate job). They share one field because the contract defines only the
/// job fields; the effect does not report which of them applied.
///
/// Applying the same submission again is harmless: the hire is already funded
/// by its transaction and the effect answers ok without reading the chain.
///
/// After a successful `give_feedback`, [onFeedbackGiven] checks that the hire
/// exists and is `completed` and answers ok; confirming the submission is
/// what makes it the hire's `feedbackReference`.
///
/// The tracker only calls this for transactions the server relayed, and
/// [StoredSubmission.hireId] ties the transaction to its hire. Never call it
/// with a transaction hash a client supplied: anyone can replay a public
/// funding transaction.
