## 1. Set up your machine

Use **these exact versions**. CI uses them too, and mismatches cause dependency errors.

| Tool | Version | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flutter (includes Dart) | **3.44.4** (Dart 3.12.2) | Everything |
| Serverpod CLI | **4.0.4** | Backend code generation |
| Docker Desktop | Latest | Local Postgres + Redis for the backend |
| Git | Latest | Everything |
| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | Latest | Optional, for PRs from the terminal |
| Node.js | 18+ | Only for `design/logo-lab` |
| Rust + Stellar CLI | Rust **1.98.1**+, Stellar CLI **28.0.0** | Only for Soroban contracts. See [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md) |

### 1.1 Flutter and Dart

1. Follow the official guide for your OS: <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install>. Choose the **web** target.
2. Switch to the pinned version:

   ```bash
   cd <your-flutter-folder>
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout 3.44.4
   flutter --version   # must say Flutter 3.44.4 and Dart 3.12.2
   ```

3. Check your setup: `flutter doctor`. For this project you only need **Chrome (web)** to be ✓.

### 1.2 Serverpod CLI

```bash
dart pub global activate serverpod_cli 4.0.4
serverpod version
```

If `serverpod` is not found, add the pub cache `bin` folder to your `PATH`:

| OS | Folder |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache\bin` |
| macOS / Linux | `$HOME/.pub-cache/bin` |

The CLI version must match the pinned Serverpod packages. A different major or
patch can produce a generated-code diff that CI rejects.

### 1.3 Docker

Install Docker Desktop (<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>) and make sure it is running: `docker --version`.

---

## 2. Run the project

The canonical step-by-step path (fresh clone → server and app against testnet) is **[docs/infra/secrets.md → Run against testnet from a fresh clone](docs/infra/secrets.md#run-against-testnet-from-a-fresh-clone)**. This section only adds context.

### 2.1 Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zer0-Knowledge-Hack/puls3.git
cd puls3
flutter pub get        # installs the whole workspace (server, client, app)
```

The repo is a **Dart pub workspace**. The root `pubspec.yaml` groups `puls3_server`, `puls3_client`, and `puls3_flutter`, so one `pub get` covers all three.

### 2.2 Run the app (frontend only)

The app loads the agent catalog from the server and falls back to the bundled demo catalog when the server is unreachable, so it also runs without the backend:

```bash
cd puls3_flutter
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define-from-file=../.env
```

`../.env` is the root config (`cp .env.example .env`).

To check a production build:

```bash
flutter build web --release
npx http-server build/web -p 5000    # open http://localhost:5000
```

Use a port other than 8080, because the backend uses 8080.

### 2.3 Run the backend

Follow steps 2, 3 and 5 of the [canonical path](docs/infra/secrets.md#run-against-testnet-from-a-fresh-clone): local secrets, root `.env`, then `docker compose up --build --detach`, `set -a; . ../.env; set +a` and `dart bin/main.dart --apply-migrations` from `puls3_server/`. Stop with `Ctrl+C`, then `docker compose stop`.

| Service | Local port |
| --- | --- |
| API server | 8080 |
| Serverpod Insights | 8081 |
| Web server | 8082 |
| Postgres (dev / test) | 8090 / 9090 |
| Redis (dev / test) | 8091 / 9091 |

### 2.4 After changing Serverpod models or endpoints

```bash
cd puls3_server
serverpod generate
```

Always commit the generated code. CI and reviewers check that `serverpod generate` leaves no diff.

### 2.5 Checks to run before opening a PR

```bash
# Domain
cd puls3_domain && dart analyze --fatal-infos && dart test

# Server (requires the test services from `docker compose up -d`)
cd puls3_server && dart analyze --fatal-infos && dart test
serverpod generate && git diff --exit-code -- ../puls3_server ../puls3_client

# App
cd puls3_flutter && flutter analyze --fatal-infos && flutter test
flutter build web --release

# Contracts
cd contracts && cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test
stellar contract build
```

## 3. How we work

### 3.1 Issues

Every piece of work starts from an issue. Each issue has:

- **Exactly one area label:**
  - `area: docs` · `area: architecture` · `area: domain` · `area: contracts`
  - `area: backend` · `area: blueprints` · `area: frontend` · `area: infra`
- **One type label:** `type: feat` · `type: docs` · `type: spike` · `type: chore`
- **One priority:** `P0` (blocks a deadline) · `P1` · `P2`
- **A milestone:** `Stellar Odyssey (Sep 25)` · `Stellar Elite (Oct 10)` · `Serverpod (Oct 14)` · `HackMeridian (Oct 25)`

Each issue lists its **Deliverables**, **Acceptance criteria**, **How to verify**, **Out of scope**, and **Depends on**. Read all of them before starting. New issues use the **Task** form, which requires all of these fields.

**To take an issue:** assign yourself on GitHub and leave a comment. Check its **Depends on** list first: if a dependency is still open, coordinate with its owner.

### 3.2 Branches

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-slug>
```

Examples: `feat/13-identity-registry`, `docs/2-vision`, `chore/29-ci`.

Always branch from an up-to-date `main`.

### 3.3 Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):

```
feat(app): add hire confirmation screen
fix(server): reject replayed payment hashes
docs: add product vision
chore: pin Flutter version in CI
```

Keep commits small and focused. Keep tests and docs in the same commit as the code they cover.

### 3.4 Pull requests

1. Open the PR against `main`. The description is pre-filled from `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
2. In the description:
   - `Closes #N` **only if every acceptance criterion is met**. Otherwise, use `Refs #N` and say what is missing.
   - Copy the issue's acceptance criteria as a checklist and tick what is done.
   - Add evidence: command output, screenshots, GIFs, tx hashes, as the issue asks.
3. Add the same labels and milestone as the issue.
4. CI must be green.

**Review rule:** a PR is approved only when **every acceptance criterion is checked** and the issue's **How to verify** steps pass for the reviewer. It needs at least **1 approval from someone other than the author**. If something is missing, the reviewer requests changes and names the exact criterion that failed.

### 3.5 Where each area lives

This table follows [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-system-architecture.md#3-repo-layout).

| Area label | Folder |
| --- | --- |
| `area: docs` | `docs/`, `assets/`, `design/` |
| `area: architecture` | `docs/adr/`, `docs/architecture/`, `docs/spikes/`, `spikes/` |
| `area: blueprints` | `docs/blueprints/` |
| `area: domain` | `puls3_domain/` (pure Dart package, created by #9) |
| `area: contracts` | `contracts/` (Cargo workspace, created by #12) |
| `area: backend` | `puls3_server/`, and `puls3_client/` through `serverpod generate` only |
| `area: frontend` | `puls3_flutter/` |
| `area: infra` | `.github/`, `scripts/` |

---

## 4. Code conventions

### Architecture

- **Hexagonal:** business rules live in a pure Dart domain, which must not import Serverpod, Flutter, or the Stellar SDK. Frameworks and the chain are adapters behind ports. This is defined in ADR-0001 (#5).
- **Flutter UI:**
  - **Atomic design:** `lib/src/ui/atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`; screens in `lib/src/screens`.
  - **Container/presentational:** presentational widgets receive data through their constructors and never call the client. Only containers hold state and call services.
- **Money is never a `double`.** Store amounts as integers in the asset's smallest unit (USDC has 7 decimals, so 0.50 USDC = `5000000`).

### Design and brand

- Follow the **[brand guide](docs/brand/README.md)**.
- All colors, fonts, and spacing come from the theme file (`puls3_flutter/lib/src/theme/puls3_theme.dart`), which mirrors `docs/brand/tokens.json`. **No hex colors anywhere else.**
- Never use Stellar yellow `#FDDA24`, and never imitate the Stellar logo. Our identity is *inspired by* Stellar, not copied.
- Use the logo SVGs from `assets/brand/`. Never retype the logo as text.

### Language

Code, comments, UI copy, docs, commits, and PRs are in **English**.

---

## 5. Security rules

The repo is **public**. Anything you push can be seen and copied.

- **Never commit secrets:** Stellar secret seeds (`S…`), API keys, passwords, or `.env` files.
- Local secrets live in git-ignored files (`puls3_server/.env`, `puls3_server/config/passwords.yaml`). Use `scripts/setup-local-secrets.sh` to create them.
- Read keys from environment variables, and document every new one in the root `.env.example` (and any new secret in [`docs/infra/secrets.md`](docs/infra/secrets.md)). `bash scripts/tests/env-inventory.test.sh` checks both.
- If you leak a secret, tell the team right away and rotate it. Deleting the commit is not enough.

---

## 6. Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs only the checks affected by a change, except **Secrets**,
which scans every pull request and every push to `main`.

| CI component | Paths | Commands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | `puls3_domain/` and workspace manifests | `dart analyze --fatal-infos`, `dart test` |
| Server | server, generated client, domain, and workspace manifests | `dart analyze --fatal-infos`, `dart test`, reproducible `serverpod generate` |
| App | Flutter app, generated client, and workspace manifests | `flutter analyze --fatal-infos`, `flutter test`, `flutter build web --release` |
| Contracts | `contracts/` | format, Clippy, tests, and `stellar contract build` |
| Secrets | all changes | Gitleaks CLI 8.30.1 with the repository's Stellar seed rule |

The Dart/Flutter and Rust dependency caches are restored automatically. The
server job provides PostgreSQL and Redis service containers and creates an
ephemeral test-only `passwords.yaml`; no repository secret is required.

### Required `main` branch protection (repository admin)

An administrator must configure a ruleset for `main` with:

- pull requests required before merging;
- at least one approval from someone other than the author;
- required status checks: `CI / gate` and `Secrets / scan`;
- branches required to be up to date before merging;
- direct pushes and force pushes blocked; and
- administrators included, unless an emergency bypass policy is documented.

The CI workflow always runs. It detects the changed paths, skips unrelated
component jobs, and exposes one stable `CI / gate` check. The gate fails if path
detection or any applicable component fails; skipped unrelated jobs are valid.

The acceptance tests that prove path filtering, merge blocking, secret
detection, and warm-cache duration require temporary remote pull requests and
repository-admin access. They cannot be proven by local commands alone.

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `version solving failed` / `requires SDK version ^3.12.2` | Your Flutter is not 3.44.4 (Dart 3.12.2). See [1.1](#11-flutter-and-dart). |
| `serverpod: command not found` | Add the pub cache `bin` folder to your `PATH` ([1.2](#12-serverpod-cli)). |
| `set it in puls3_server/.env` when running Docker | Run `./scripts/setup-local-secrets.sh` first. |
| Port 8080 already in use | Another process uses it (maybe a static server). Stop it, or serve the web build on another port. |
| The web app shows an old version | Hard reload with `Ctrl+Shift+R`: Flutter caches the app in a service worker. |
| `AgentCatalogUnavailable`, or the catalog looks empty or stale | Read the server log line `[agent-catalog] warning: Agent catalog rebuild failed ...` and see [7.1](#71-soroban-rpc-timeout). |

### 7.1 Soroban RPC timeout

Every Soroban RPC call has a client timeout of 8 s, set with `PULS3_STELLAR_RPC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (a positive whole number of seconds; anything else stops the server at startup). It applies to each request, not to a whole catalog build, which on a cold start makes dozens of `simulateTransaction` calls. If one fails, the build is abandoned.

The cause is in the log line, which carries the exception type and message:

| Log message | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<method> timed out after <timeout>` | The client timeout was hit. | Raise the setting. 20 s is a good first try: above the documented 15 s simulation limit, below the 25 s request limit, and the value the Studio deploy already uses. |
| `<method> answered HTTP 504` | The server hit its request limit (`MAX_REQUEST_EXECUTION_DURATION`, 25 s by default). | Raising the client timeout will not help. Use another RPC provider. |
| `<method> answered JSON-RPC error -32001: ...` | The server hit its simulation limit (`MAX_SIMULATE_TRANSACTION_EXECUTION_DURATION`, 15 s by default). | Same: use another RPC provider. |

The 15 s and 25 s values are the `stellar-rpc` defaults from the [admin guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/apis/rpc/admin-guide/configuring). Providers can set their own, so the setting is not capped.

A larger value has a cost: while the chain is down, each request that triggers a rebuild waits until the call fails (up to the configured value) before it gets the stale catalog, so users wait longer during an outage.
